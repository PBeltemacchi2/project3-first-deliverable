        <h3>About Myself</h3>
         <p>I became interested in chemistry before I learned about material science and engineering. In fourth grade, my dad bought a book on the elements that grabbed my attention like nothing else I had previously studied.  I had already gone over this book several times before finishing fourth grade. I began to watch videos on chemistry and quickly realized this was my calling. By eighth grade, I had learned about material science and knew I would major in it.</p>
