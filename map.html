PROJECT THREE: ADD JAVASCRIPT
Project Description
For this project, you will add 2 media queries and 2 JavaScript tools.

Deliverables & Milestones
First Deliverable: Use your Project Two directory in Github to create a Project Three directory. You can fork it or just copy and paste. Create a new Basecamp post under "Project Three" with a link to your new directory. Your post should include:
The URL to your Project 3 GitHub repository, and the URL to your index.html Github Pages live link
Eight screen capture images of successful validation. One HTML and one CSS validation for each website page.
Two questions eliciting feedback from fellow students
Second Deliverable: Give constructive comments to help at least three other students. Post a picture of those three comments on your Basecamp folder.
Final Deliverable: You will receive a list on your Basecamp post of required fixes from the professor or TA. Fix your code and edit your original Basecamp post with the words "FINAL TURN IN".
Requirements
ALL THE REQUIRMENTS FROM PROJECT 1 AND 2 STILL APPLY!
Fix any point reductions you received with Project 2:Final Turn in. They will be deducted again if not fixed.
Pick one page to make mobile friendly. This means adding 2 CSS media queries with at least 5 CSS style changes under each. Use the min-width media queries.
Add a fourth html page for your Google Maps api. The map should have 3 features added beyond the base code.
Add one valid, error-free JavaScript file with your original code; linked from the head of all four HTML files
Make sure your JavaScript throws no uncaught errors and is loaded unobtrusively. You can check for errors using the console on your browser inspector
For the final turn-in, add a JavaScript picture slider to one of your pages.
