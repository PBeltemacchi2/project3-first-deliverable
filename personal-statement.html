        <h3>Materials Science and Engineering Personal Statement</h3>
        <p>I became interested in chemistry before I learned about material science and engineering. In fourth grade, my dad bought a book on the elements that grabbed my attention like nothing else I had previously studied.  I had already gone over this book several times before finishing fourth grade. I began to watch videos on chemistry and quickly realized this was my calling. By eighth grade, I had learned about material science and knew I would major in it.</p>
        <p>As early as my first year of high school, I already had experience in this field. My elective during my first year was a materials science course. We would do experiments in which we would create materials from two substances. We studied the main groupings of materials and compared their properties. The main experience in the class was reading scientific reports on materials.</p> 
        <p>During my first year of college, I enrolled in a course called Mechanical, Materials, and Aerospace Engineering. This course had four parts; the first was studying our field's ethics which teaches us how to behave professionally. The following three parts were group projects. The first project was creating a catapult that would use spin to make the projectile launch much farther. We had to use complex math to predict how far our projectile would go during this project. The second project was creating a working instrument. Materials science was essential for this project. We first had to research what materials were best for reverbing and enhancing the sound from the strings. The third project was inventing a prototype for a completely new product. My group decided on Tupperware, which would detect if the food was spoiled using a gas detector. My job in this project was to build and test our product. I put together the electronics and tested them to see if our project was viable at fridge temperatures.</p>
        <p>I was an exceptional student and a hard worker at my high school. I was enrolled in all AP and honors classes and was in the science olympiad and STEM clubs. I joined the National Honors Society as soon as possible and was inducted. In my senior year, I was the only student in my graduating class to receive the award and honor of being an Illinois Scholar.</p>
        <p>I first learned of IIT from my grandfather, an architecture professor, Peter Beltemacchi Senior Later, my father started to work for IIT and started to show me different majors and opportunities the school had for students. He showed me the research pages on the website, and I became interested. Later, when looking at different universities, I saw that IIT was considered a private research institution. I realized this was the school for me because my dream job is to be a materials science and engineering researcher.</p>
        <p>I would like to join IIT’s graduate program as this will help and allow me to reach my goals, dreams, and full potential. My future goals are to become a successful materials science researcher and to earn a doctorate degree in this field. I hope to work for IIT as a research scientist and make great discoveries for IIT. I will want to work with Fred Hickernell, Vice Provost for Research, although he is not in the same major he has insights on how to conduct research I would like to learn. Like him, I wish to answer the questions in my field which do not already have an answer.</p>
